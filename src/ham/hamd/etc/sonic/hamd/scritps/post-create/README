# After hamd adds a user to /etc/passwd with the useradd command, hamd
# invokes, in ASCIIbetical order, the scripts found in this directory.
#
# Hamd invokes each script as follows:
#
#   [SCRIPT] [USER NAME] [ATTRIBUTES]
#
# ATTRIBUTES is a string of semi-colon separated attributes. Currently, only
# two attributes are supported, the roles and the privilege level.
#
# The "roles" attribute is a list of comma-separated roles. For example:
#    roles=[comma-separated roles]
#
# The privilege level is an integer in the range 0 to 15. For example:
#   priv-lvl=11
#
# Examples:
#    SCRIPT bob roles=netoperator,secadmin;priv-lvl=13
#    SCRIPT jane priv-lvl=13
#    SCRIPT wyatt roles=sysadmin
#
# Each SCRIPT should return 0 on success, and non-0 on failure. On failure,
# each SCRIPT should print the cause of the failure to the standard
# error (stderr).
